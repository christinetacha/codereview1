                <li>I worked at Radio Cab for many years, performing different duties. However, for the past two years I have been a driver. This position has helped me develop essential life skills, such as managing my own finances, and developing intrinsic motivation. In addition to those necessary skills, it has also helped my judgment improve, from assessing risk, to driving defensively. While my time at Radio Cab has been invaluable and I enjoyed it a great deal, it's simply time to move on. Enter programming!</li>
